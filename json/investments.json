That’s why we want to help you get comfortable investing, starting with 3 easy steps.\n\n1. Get your investor profile.\n2. Match to the fund that suits.\n3. See the expected range of returns\n\nEquity markets are volatile, they go down as well as up. They should be viewed as a medium to long term investment. The longer you keep your money invested, the greater the chances of a positive outcome. \n\nStaying fully invested through a market cycle has, in the past, ensured investors enjoy gains over the long-term as rebounds can recover any falls.\n\nAlways keep the following points in mind when investing:\n\n•\t**Stay disciplined** – stick to your plan. If unsure speak to your adviser.\n\n•\t**Volatility is normal.** Markets will fall and rise and sometimes will have severe shocks. Expect these and remember that historically each market downturn has been followed by an eventual upswing.\n\n•\tKeeping money in **cash is not the long term answer**. Bank deposit returns well below inflation with the State Savings Scheme currently offering 1.32% AER on a 3 year deposit (Feb 2024).\n\n•\tOver the **longer term** holding money in risker assets such as equities is rewarded\n\na) In any ten year period multi asset funds have never made a loss\n\nb) In any twenty year period equities have never made a loss\n\n•\t**Diversify, diversify, diversify**. Spread your eggs across many baskets. This is how a well-managed multi asset fund can be less volatile than equities\n\n•\t**Research** properly any ESG funds you may be interested in investing in.",
