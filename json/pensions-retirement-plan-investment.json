Savings may need to last more than 20 years into retirement\n\n•\tIncreased **pressure on the state pension** with our ageing demographics. According to the Pension Commission (Feb 2021) *“People are living longer in Ireland. In 2016, 13.3% of the population (less than one in seven) was 65 years of age or older. By 2051, the CSO (Central Statistics Office) projects it to be 25.9% (more than one in four).”* They go on to say *“people are spending less of their life at work, and more of it in retirement. And with the ageing population, there will be a relatively smaller proportion of working people to pay a higher pension bill.\"*\n\n•\t**Generous income tax relief.** With every €100 invested you pay €80 as a 20% tax payer or €60 as a 40% tax payer. (Correct as per Tax rates, 2020)\n\n•\t**Tax free lump sum** on retirement of up to €200,000 (Correct as per Tax rates, 2020)\n\n•\tInvestment **options** to suit every investor type\n\n**Talk to a financial adviser to help with your pension planning.**\n\nWarning: The value of your investment may go down as well as up",
