  "body": "\n\n**Responsible Investing (ESG)**\n\nDid you know that just 100 companies are reported to be responsible for 71% of global greenhouse gas emissions (Guardian, 2017).\n\n**Improve the world with your savings.** Responsible investment (RI) funds select companies which demonstrate the best environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. We believe that these may offer investors the best of both worlds: seeking attractive financial returns and a possibility to allocate money to causes they care about.\n\n**Sustainable Finance Statements**\t\n\n*While Mind My Money considers the approach taken by Irish Life Assurance plc in terms of them integrating sustainability risks into their product offering as we have selected one preferred provider for investment products, analysis when choosing a suitable product for you will be limited to products provided by Irish Life Assurance plc. However, should you specifically seek a financial product which has sustainable investment as its sole/specific objective and no such product is available from the range of products offered by Irish Life Assurance Plc, Mind My Money will conduct analysis of the product offerings available from the other insurance undertakings, lenders and product providers with whom Mind My Money holds written appointments.*\n\n*When providing advice, Mind My Money does not consider the adverse impacts of investment decisions on sustainability. The firm will review this annually and makes revisions if and when appropriate.*\n\nWarning: The value of your investment may go down as well as up"
