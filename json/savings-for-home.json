  "body": "Most of us want to own our home. It fills us with a sense of pride and achievement. But, our home also means much more to us than that. We consider our home a safe haven. A place where we can spend time with our family and friends. However, with 10% of the value of your first house required upfront, buying your new home requires planning. Traditional deposits pose a problem as our money just can’t grow fast enough to even keep up with house inflation, especially at today’s low Interest rates.\n\nThree questions you need to consider:\n\n1. Goals: how much do I need to save to afford a deposit on my desired home?.\n2. Timeframe: how much time do I have to let my savings grow?.\n3. Choice: what financial vehicles can I invest in to meet my objectives?\n\n   ![](/assets/imgages/uploads/ggfsdd.jpg)"
