It is our most important asset. \n\nBut what happens if the unthinkable happens and your income stops? How does your family survive and reach its potential without the income as support? \n\n\nWe buy items with our income and insure them. It makes as much, if not more sense, to insure the golden goose that lays the eggs as it does the eggs themselves.\n\n\n**At Mind My Money we put Family First by helping to protect your future income.**\n\n\nThere are various product types available. <span style=\"color:#0080FF\">**They do a different, but complimentary job.**</span> You need to make sure that you select the best mix of products to protect your income from short-, medium- and long-term loss.\nThe main categories are;\n\n1. Life assurance, \n2. Income protection\n3. Specified Illness Cover, \n4. Mortgage protection.\n   Our Family First section will give you more information on these different types of protection."
